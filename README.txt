# Aviachipta Narxini Bashorat Qilish

## Project Description
This project is focused on predicting flight ticket prices using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of predictive models to provide accurate price forecasts. The notebook is written in Python and designed for users interested in data analysis and machine learning.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering for better model performance
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Evaluation of model accuracy and performance metrics
